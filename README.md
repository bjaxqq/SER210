# SER210

### Course Description

This course serves as an introduction to software engineering using object-oriented analysis and design. The course emphasizes the development of robust and high-quality software systems based on object-oriented principles. Implementations are performed using state-of-the-art programming languages and application development frameworks.

### Tools and Languages Used

This course is entirely focused on Android Development, so we had to use Kotlin for our assignments and projects. The majority of the work was done in Android Studio with the exception of Assignment 1 which was tested in IntelliJ (terminal based connect-4 game).

### Group Work

Although most of the classwork for SER210 is on this repository, I have another GitHub account that I use for collaborative school projects that can be found [here](https://github.com/bajackson1). This includes all of those projects as well as a [documentation website](https://bajackson1.github.io/documentation/) for it.
